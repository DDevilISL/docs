# The VGL Doctrine

Creating a minigame should be more about being focused with game logic and creating cool things, rather than focusing on rewriting tons of code and having to watch out for bugs all of the time.

VGL takes away the crap associated with making a minigame, and lets you, the developer, focus on creating something cool and focusing on game logic instead.

VoxelGamesLib was made and is developed with certain fundamental ideas in mind. This doctrine will help you better understand them. Keep these in mind as you write your own games extending VGL.
