# The VGL Doctrine

Creating a minigame should be more about being focused with game logic and creating cool things,
rather than focusing on rewriting tons of code and having to watch out for bugs all of the time.

VGL takes away the crap associated with making a minigame and lets developers focus on creating
something cool and focusing on game logic instead.

What does this mean for you as a player? Developers can create new games faster, find bugs easier and 
generally are more motivated.

What does this mean for you as a server admin? You can choose from a wide range of gamemodes without having to
deal with capability issues.

VoxelGamesLib was made and is developed with certain fundamental ideas in mind.
This doctrine will help you better understand them. Keep these in mind as you write your own games extending VGL.

## Modularity

This might be the most important concept. If you click around a bit on this documentation you will spot 
the components VGL is made of. Its our number one priority to make sure that every piece of code you write can be 
reused elsewhere.
