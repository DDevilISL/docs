# Contribute translations

This page will explain how you can contribute your translated string 
to the project so everybody can enjoy VGL in their native language.

VGL uses POEditor. POEditor is a site that allows a community to easily contribute on translating a project. All you have to sign up on their site and request to join the VGL project. You then can choose a language and start translating away! You also can correct translations by others or use the comments under every string to discuss wording and stuff like that. 
(TODO insert links here)

## Language String format

VGL has its own format for how you can format messages. It allows you to include text colors, text decorations, click and hover events and variables.  
The parser for the messages was written to be as forgiving as possible, so small syntax errors (like forgetting to close a color tag) will still be rendered ingame, altho it might produce a different output as you might expect.
