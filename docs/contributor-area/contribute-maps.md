# Contribute Maps

VGL has a public maps repository so that you can start your server without
needing to look for good maps first.  
You can find the repo here https://github.com/VoxelGamesLib/maps

If you want to submit your map to that repository, just open a PR and fill
out the information in the template (name, author, screenshot etc)
