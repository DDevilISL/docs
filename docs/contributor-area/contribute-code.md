# Contributing code

This is probably the hardest way to contribute since you need to pass
a proper review and test of all your changes.  
But as scary as this might look at first, it's really not. This document
aims to guide you through the process of opening a PR and make the process
as easy as possible for everyone.

If you just spot this page, thats very unluck since it has no actual content
yet.
