# Components

There are 3 types of components in VGL

* **Features**  
  Feature often refers to a certain small, modular set of logic that is
  used to build phases and games. A feature can be nearly everything, from
  disabling PVP or blocking block break to complex spawn or team selection 
  algorithms.  
  You can find a list of features [here](features.md)
      
* **Phases**
  A phase in a game is a timespan where certain gameplay parts (Features)
  are active. It can end after a special time or after a certain condition.
