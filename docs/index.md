# VoxelGamesLib Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the VoxelGamesLib documentation.

VoxelGamesLib is a powerful, feature-packed, abstract and expandable Minecraft minigames framework.

If you are an end user wishing to configure a game that extends VoxelGamesLib, please refer to that game developer's documentation, or the [end-user wiki](https://github.com/VoxelGamesLib/VoxelGamesLibv2/wiki).

This documentation aims to get you started with developing games using VoxelGamesLib. By the end of this documentation you will be able to create advanced, yet organised, and hopefully fun to play games.

This documentation assumes that you are familiar with the Java language and the Bukkit API.
