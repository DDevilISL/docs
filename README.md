Made using mkdocs

# Building

You need to have python and pip installed.  
If you don't have mkdocs installed, do so using `pip install mkdocs`  
We use the material theme, so you also want to install that `pip install mkdocs-material`  
To start a local instance of the documentation use `mkdocs serve`
