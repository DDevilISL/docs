# VoxelGamesLib Documentation

Made using mkdocs

# Contributing

You can make issues here for stuff that seems wrong and you can open PRs to change stuff around. Your issues and PRs will be reviewed and handeled by members of the [@documentation](https://github.com/orgs/VoxelGamesLib/teams/documentation) team.

# Building

You need to have python and pip installed.  
If you don't have mkdocs installed, do so using `pip install mkdocs`  
We use the material theme, so you also want to install that `pip install mkdocs-material`  
To start a local instance of the documentation use `mkdocs serve`
